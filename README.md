Earthquake Data Engineering Pipeline with Microsoft Fabric

Overview: Built an end-to-end data pipeline to process earthquake events from the USGS API using Python, PySpark, and Microsoft Fabric (Data Factory & Data Engineering).

Pipeline:

Bronze Layer: Ingested raw earthquake data with minimal processing.

Silver Layer: Cleaned, transformed, and consolidated data for analysis.

Gold Layer: Created refined, business-ready datasets for reporting and visualization in Power BI.

Data: Includes event ID, location (latitude/longitude), elevation, magnitude, significance, timestamps, and descriptions.
